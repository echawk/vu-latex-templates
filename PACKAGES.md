# List of Needed LaTeX packages

NOTE: This is really just for reference, most LaTeX installations install *every* package as the default.

| Package  | Reason                                                                                        |
| :------: | :-----------------------------------------------------:                                       |
| babel    | "Americanizes" the bibliography; changes certain conventions                                  |
| biblatex | Enables Bibliography management in LaTeX                                                      |
| csquotes | Changes the behavior of quotes; used to make them "American"; only used for the bibliography  |
| fancyhdr | Allows for the setting of a custom header                                                     |
| geometry | Allows for granular control of the margin size                                                |

| inputenc | By default LaTeX doesn't use UTF-8; when using this package, it does                          |
| setspace | Allows for linespacing to be manually set                                                     |
| wrapfig  | By default LaTeX figures don't wrap text around them, so this package provides an alternative |
